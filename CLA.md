# Questions Hub — Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
Version 1.0

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is between **you** ("Contributor")
and **Ivan Misyats** ("Maintainer") for contributions to the **Questions Hub** project
(the "Project") hosted on GitHub.

By submitting a Contribution (as defined below) to the Project (for example via a pull request,
patch, issue attachment, or any other form of source code contribution), you agree to the terms
of this Agreement.

## 1. Definitions
- **"Contribution"** means any work of authorship that you intentionally submit to the Project,
  including source code, documentation, configuration, tests, build scripts, and other materials,
  and any associated metadata (such as commit messages), excluding anything you clearly mark in
  writing at the time of submission as **"Not a Contribution"**.
- **"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project,
  its Maintainer, or its repository channels, where the content is intended to be incorporated into
  the Project.

## 2. Copyright license grant to the Project (AGPL)
You grant the Maintainer and all recipients of the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions as part of the Project
under the Project’s open-source license (currently **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**).

## 3. Additional license grant to the Maintainer (relicensing right)
In addition to Section 2, you grant the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:
- use your Contributions for any purpose,
- prepare derivative works of your Contributions,
- distribute your Contributions and derivative works under **any license terms** (including proprietary
  or commercial licenses),
- sublicense your Contributions and derivative works to third parties under any license terms,
- and to change the Project’s license for future versions **without any obligation to provide notice**
  to you or other contributors.

For clarity:
- This Agreement does **not** revoke or modify licenses already granted for past versions.
- Your Contributions may still be available under prior open-source terms for versions already published.

## 4. Patent license grant
You grant the Maintainer and all recipients of the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated below) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Project, where such license applies only
to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone
or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the Project.

If you initiate patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) alleging that the Project or a
Contribution incorporated into the Project constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
any patent licenses granted to you under this Agreement for the Project terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

## 5. Your representations
You represent that:
1) You have the legal right to grant the licenses in this Agreement.
2) To the best of your knowledge, your Contribution does not include third-party copyrighted material,
   trade secrets, or confidential information unless you have permission to submit it under this Agreement.
3) If your employer or another party has rights to your Contribution, you have received permission to
   submit it under this Agreement.

## 6. No warranty
Your Contributions are provided "AS IS", without warranties or conditions of any kind, express or implied.

## 7. Miscellaneous
- This Agreement applies to all Contributions you submit to the Project, now or in the future, unless you
  explicitly state otherwise in writing at the time of submission and the Maintainer agrees in writing.
- If any provision of this Agreement is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

---
**How to agree:** by submitting a pull request (or any Contribution) you indicate acceptance of this Agreement.
